/**
 * lib/rbac/ability.ts
 *
 * Build a CASL `Ability` from a user's effective role assignments + scopes.
 *
 * CASL's model:
 *   ability.can(action, subject) - where subject is either a *type name*
 *   (string like "Zone") or an *instance* (object with a `__type` field).
 *
 * Our adapter:
 *   - "Actions" are the second halves of our permission strings ("read",
 *     "create", "update", "delete", "configure", ...).
 *   - "Subject types" are the first halves capitalized ("Zone", "Record",
 *     "Dnssec", ...). See `SubjectType` below.
 *   - At rule definition time (`AbilityBuilder.can(...)`) we pass the subject
 *     *type name*. CASL types require this - passing the instance type union
 *     here doesn't typecheck.
 *   - At check time (`ability.can(...)`), callers may pass either a subject
 *     type name (existence check) or an instance (scoped check). The
 *     `detectSubjectType` callback below maps an instance to its type name.
 *   - Scope is matched per resource via CASL's `conditions` mechanism: a
 *     team-scoped assignment grants the action only when the resource's
 *     `teamId` (for zones/records) or `id` (for teams) matches the scope.
 *
 * The ability is built once per request, cached on the request context, and
 * passed to `lib/rbac/policy.ts`'s `can()` helper.

 * the user do this to *some* instance?" - so it returns `true` for a rule that
 * is conditionally scoped to one team/zone/server. That makes it unsafe as a
 * blanket ("any instance") authorization decision: a team-scoped Operator
 * would pass `ability.can("update", "Record")` and appear to have access to
 * every zone on every backend.
 *
 * A genuine "all instances" capability is exactly a **global** grant. Callers
 * that must make an all-instances decision (zone/record/dnssec/metadata
 * operations - which have no zone→team mapping and are gated per-zone by
 * `zone_grants` instead - plus zone/server *creation* and admin-wide list
 * endpoints) consult this set. Callers holding a concrete resource pass a
 * subject instance to `ability.can` for a properly scoped check.
