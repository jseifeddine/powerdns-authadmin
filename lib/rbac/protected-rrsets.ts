/**

 *
 * Two RRsets in every zone are not "records" in the sense a self-service
 * editor means it - they are the zone's standing in DNS:
 *
 *   - **SOA** at the apex: authority, the responsible mailbox, and the
 *     refresh/retry/expire/minimum timers every secondary obeys. Get it
 *     wrong and transfers stall or the zone expires off the secondaries.
 *   - **NS** at the apex: the delegation. Remove it and the zone stops
 *     being served, however healthy the rest of the records are.
 *
 * Both used to be reachable with plain `record.update`, which is the
 * permission a hosting provider hands their customers so they can point
 * an A record at a new box (#119). This module names the extra
 * permission each one costs, so the RRset write path and the record
 * editor agree on the answer without either re-deriving it.
 *
 * Deliberately pure and dependency-free (no `server-only`): the record
 * editor is a client component and needs the same predicate to decide
 * which rows to lock, and the unit tests want it without a DB.
 *
 * NS *below* the apex is an ordinary record - a child delegation is
 * content, not this zone's own authority - so it needs only `record.*`.
 *
 * ADR-0023 records why the SOA is modelled as its own resource (so
 * `soa.update` REPLACES the record permission) while the apex NS stays a
 * record with an extra cost (`record.update.apex-ns` is ADDITIVE).
 */

/**
 * Extra permission a write to this RRset costs, or `null` when the
 * RRset is an ordinary record.
 *
 * `soa.update` REPLACES the `record.*` requirement (SOA is its own
 * resource, with its own editor and its own read permission).
 * `record.update.apex-ns` is ADDITIVE - an apex NS write still needs
 * the matching `record.create`/`record.update`/`record.delete`.
