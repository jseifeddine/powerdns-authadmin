# Roles & permissions (RBAC)

Access is granted by assigning **roles** to users, optionally **scoped** to a
team, zone, or server. A role is a named bundle of permissions; the effective
permission set is the union of a user's assignments that apply in context.

## The five system roles

Seeded on first boot and protected from deletion. Each builds on the previous -
the description shown here is the one seeded into the `roles.description`
column, surfaced verbatim on the Roles list and detail pages.

| Role            | Seeded description                                                                                     | Permissions, in addition to the role above…                                                                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Read Only**   | View access to assigned zones. No changes. Useful for auditors and observers.                          | View zones, records, DNSSEC, metadata, teams, users, roles, servers, settings; use templates; manage own API tokens (read). |
| **Zone Editor** | Edit records on assigned zones. Cannot create or delete zones, change the SOA, or repoint the apex NS. | Create/update/delete **records**; create/delete own API tokens.                                                             |
| **Operator**    | Day-to-day zone and record administration within a team. No DNSSEC or member management.               | Update the **SOA** + **apex NS**; create/update/delete/import/export **zones**; write metadata; manage templates.           |
| **Team Owner**  | Full control of a team's zones and members. Cannot manage other teams or app-wide settings.            | Configure DNSSEC; manage TSIG + autoprimaries; update team + manage members.                                                |
| **Super Admin** | Full access to everything: users, roles, servers, settings, audit.                                     | Everything: users, roles, teams, servers, settings, audit, OIDC, all API tokens.                                            |

The seed asserts Super Admin contains every permission, so a new permission added
to the codebase is always held by Super Admin. The seeded descriptions are owned
by `lib/rbac/default-roles.ts`; edits there apply on next boot via `upsertRole`.

Custom roles carry an optional free-text description too - set it on the create
or edit form. It's shown verbatim on the Roles list and detail pages and surfaces
naturally as "what does this role do?" context for newer operators.

## Permission vocabulary

Custom roles are built from these. Names are stable strings (`resource.action`):

| Group            | Permissions                                                                                            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

| TSIG             | `tsig.read` (list) · `tsig.manage` (create/regenerate/reveal)                                          |
| Autoprimary      | `autoprimary.manage`                                                                                   |
| Templates        | `template.use` `template.manage`                                                                       |
| Users            | `user.read` `user.create` `user.update` `user.delete` `user.disable` `user.reset-password`             |
| Teams            | `team.read` `team.create` `team.update` `team.delete` `team.manage-members`                            |
| Roles            | `role.read` `role.create` `role.update` `role.delete` `role.assign`                                    |

| Auth providers   | `auth.read` `auth.manage` (OIDC, SAML, LDAP)                                                           |
| System           | `system.backup`                                                                                        |

## Splitting record editing from a zone's authority

Three surfaces decide whether a zone works at all, and each answers to its own
permission rather than riding along with `record.update`. This is what lets you
hand someone their zone's records without handing them the zone.

| Surface                                                             | Read                 | Write                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **SOA tab** - primary NS, responsible mailbox, refresh/retry/expire | `soa.read`           | `soa.update`                                |
| **Apex NS records** - the zone's delegation                         | `record.read`        | `record.*` **plus** `record.update.apex-ns` |
| **Zone settings tab** - kind, masters, SOA-EDIT(-API), API-RECTIFY  | `zone.settings.read` | `zone.update`                               |

Notes worth knowing:

- **Tabs disappear, they don't grey out.** Without `soa.read` there is no SOA
  tab; without `zone.settings.read` there is no Zone settings tab, and a direct
  `?tab=soa` / `?tab=settings` link falls back to Records. (A user holding
  `zone.delete` still gets the settings tab, because the Danger Zone lives
  there - the settings panel itself stays hidden.)
- **`soa.update` replaces the record permission, it doesn't add to it.** The SOA
  is its own resource: `soa.update` alone is enough to edit it, and no amount of
  `record.*` substitutes for it. `record.update.apex-ns` works the other way -
  it is an _extra_ requirement layered on top of the matching `record.create` /
  `record.update` / `record.delete`.
- **NS below the apex is an ordinary record.** A child delegation
  (`sub.example.com. NS`) is content this zone serves, so `record.*` covers it.
  Only the apex NS is protected.
- **The gate is server-side.** Every write lands on the same RRset route
  whichever panel sent it, and the route classifies each change by its
  normalized name - a hand-rolled `PATCH` gets the same answer the UI does.
- **These work as per-zone grants too**, so you can allow `soa.update` on one
  customer's zone without granting it fleet-wide.

[ADR-0023](./adr/0023-zone-authority-permissions.md) records why the SOA is
modelled as its own resource while the apex NS stays a record with an extra
cost, and what was rejected on the way there.

A self-service role for a hosting customer therefore looks like:

```yaml
permissions: [zone.read, record.read, record.create, record.update, record.delete, dnssec.read]
```

Records: yes. SOA, apex NS, zone settings: not shown, not writable.

## Scopes

A role assignment can apply everywhere or be narrowed:

| Scope              | Applies to                                                              |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `global`           | The whole app.                                                          |
| `team:<slug>`      | Resources owned by the named team.                                      |
| `zone:<zone-name>` | A single zone (canonical FQDN with trailing dot, e.g. `corp.example.`). |
| `server:<slug>`    | Every zone on one backend.                                              |

Example: assign **Zone Editor** scoped to `zone:corp.example.` and the user can
edit records in that one zone and nothing else.

## Assigning roles

- **Admin UI** - assign roles to a user (with a scope) under **Admin → Users**;
  manage role definitions under **Admin → Roles**.
- **OIDC group mapping** - map an IdP group to a role + scope so membership is
  driven by your directory. These assignments are reconciled on every sign-in
  (granted when in the group, revoked when not). See [OIDC](./05-OIDC.md#group--role-mapping).

Admin-issued assignments and OIDC-managed assignments are tracked separately - the
group sync never touches an assignment an admin made by hand.

## Custom roles

Add org-specific roles in the UI (**Admin → Roles**) or in the `roles:`
[provisioning](./06-PROVISIONING.md) block. A custom role is just a slug, a name, and
a list of permissions from the vocabulary above. They can be used anywhere a
system role can, including OIDC group mappings.

```yaml
roles:
  - slug: zone-noc
    name: NOC Zone Operator
    requires_mfa: true
    permissions: [zone.read, record.create, record.update, record.delete, audit.read]
```

## MFA-required roles

A role can be marked **`requires_mfa`**. A user holding such a role must enrol TOTP
before they can act - they're redirected to enrol until they do. SSO-only users
(no local password) are exempt: their IdP is the second-factor authority, so
enforce MFA there. See [OIDC → MFA and SSO users](./05-OIDC.md#mfa-and-sso-users).
