## 1. Authentication

### 1.1 Local accounts (email + password)

- **What.** Sign in with email + Argon2id-hashed password. OWASP 2024 parameters. Hashes are
  re-derived (`needsRehash`) on every successful login if the parameter set has been tightened.
- **Where.** `lib/auth/password.ts`, `lib/auth/providers/local.ts`, `app/api/auth/login/route.ts`,
  `app/(auth)/login/`.
- **How.**
  - Bootstrap the first admin via `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL` + `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` env (see
    `.env.example`). The seed is idempotent - keyed on the email, it ensures that account exists
    and never clobbers an existing one.
  - Add more users from `/admin/users` (gated on `user.create`). The admin can issue a
    one-time temporary password that forces the user to change on first login.
  - Lockout policy is operator-tunable: `login_lockout_threshold` (1–100 attempts) and
    `login_lockout_seconds` (60–86400) on the admin Settings page.
  - The login path is constant-time even when the user doesn't exist - defends against email
    enumeration.

### 1.2 OIDC SSO

- **What.** Generic OIDC (Authorization Code + PKCE) via `openid-client`. Multiple providers
  configurable per install. Discovery happens at sign-in; the AS metadata is cached in-process.
  Auto-detects whether the IdP wants `client_secret_basic` or `client_secret_post`; falls back
  to the other method on `invalid_client` so an IdP whose advertised list disagrees with its
  per-client config still works.
- **Where.** `lib/auth/providers/oidc.ts`, `lib/auth/providers/oidc-probe.ts`,
  `app/api/auth/oidc/[provider]/{initiate,callback}/route.ts`,
  `app/(app)/admin/oidc-providers/`.
- **How.**
  - Add a provider from `/admin/authentication` (gated on `oidc.manage`). The
    unified Authentication page lists Local Auth + every configured OIDC
    provider in one table; per-provider edit pages live under
    `/admin/oidc-providers/<id>`.
  - The redirect URI to register with the IdP is `${APP_URL}/api/auth/oidc/<slug>/callback`.
  - Slugs are **globally unique across every authentication provider** (OIDC,
    SAML, LDAP) - the `auth_provider_slugs` table enforces this at the DB
    level, so the same slug can't be reused across protocol types.
  - Per-provider toggles:
    - `enabled` - hides the provider from the login page when off.
    - `require_email_verified` - default on; sign-in is blocked unless the IdP attests
      `email_verified: true`. Defends against account-takeover when the same email exists
      locally and the IdP lets users set arbitrary unverified emails. Relax it only for IdPs
      that never emit the claim.
    - `allowed_email_domains` - per-provider override of the env-level allow-list.
  - **Default sign-in method** lives on the unified Authentication page, not
    on individual providers. Pick "Local Auth" or one of the configured
    providers from the dropdown; `/login` auto-redirects on a fresh visit
    (escape hatch: `/login?force-local=1`).
  - Discovery health is operator-pollable via the **Test** button on the providers list AND
    the edit page; the result is cached on the row's `discovery_cache` field.
  - **RP-initiated logout.** When the IdP advertises an `end_session_endpoint`, sign-in
    captures it + the raw id_token on the session row. Logout navigates the browser to
    `<end_session_endpoint>?id_token_hint=…&client_id=…` so the IdP ends its own session and
    renders its signed-out screen. No `post_logout_redirect_uri` is sent - most IdPs require
    it pre-registered and silently strip it otherwise.

### 1.3 Group → role mapping (OIDC)

- **What.** Materialise role assignments from a user's IdP group claim on every sign-in.
  Assignments tagged with `provider_id` get reconciled on the next sign-in: groups the user
  no longer holds revoke the assignment, admin-issued assignments are never touched.
- **Where.** `lib/auth/providers/oidc-group-sync.ts`,
  `app/(app)/admin/oidc-providers/_components/oidc-provider-form.tsx` (the editor).
- **How.** From a provider's edit page, add rows under **Group → role mappings**: each row pairs
  an IdP group name with a role + scope. Scope syntax is `global`, `team:<slug>`,
  `zone:<fqdn>`, or `server:<slug>`. Mappings whose role/team/server can't be resolved at
  sign-in are logged + audited (`auth.oidc.group_sync.mapping_unresolved`) and skipped - the
  sign-in still succeeds.

### 1.4 TOTP (multi-factor)

- **What.** Self-service TOTP enrollment for local-password users. Inline SVG QR code rendered
  server-side via `qrcode`; manual setup-key fallback shown alongside. Standard RFC 6238 with
  SHA-1, 30s step, ±1 step skew tolerance, hand-rolled HOTP/Base32 in
  `lib/auth/totp.ts` to avoid an extra dependency.
- **Where.** `lib/auth/totp.ts`, `lib/auth/totp-qr.ts`,
  `app/(app)/profile/_components/totp-section.tsx`, `app/api/profile/mfa/totp/route.ts`,
  `app/api/auth/login/route.ts` (challenge step).
- **How.** From `/profile#mfa`, click **Enable TOTP**, scan the QR with any authenticator app,
  confirm the 6-digit code. Per-role `requires_mfa` enforcement (set on the role edit page)
  redirects non-enrolled users to `/profile?mfa-required=1` until they finish enrolment.
  **SSO-only users** (no local password) see a read-only "Managed by your identity provider"
  panel and are exempt from the `requires_mfa` gate - the IdP is their second-factor authority.

### 1.5 API tokens

- **What.** Per-user `pda_pat_…` tokens with operator-selected permission scopes from the
  user's effective set. Argon2id-hashed at rest, public prefix indexable for lookups.
- **Where.** `lib/auth/tokens.ts`, `lib/db/repositories/api-tokens.ts`,
  `app/(app)/profile/_components/api-tokens-section.tsx`,
  `app/(app)/admin/users/_components/tokens-panel.tsx`,
  `app/api/profile/api-tokens/`.
- **How.** From `/profile#api-tokens`, **Create token**, pick scopes + optional expiry. The
  plaintext value is shown ONCE and never round-tripped again. Use the token by sending it
  as `Authorization: Bearer pda_pat_…` or `X-API-Key: pda_pat_…`. Admins with `token.read.all`
  see every user's token inventory under `/admin/users/<id>/tokens`.

### 1.6 Sessions

- **What.** DB-backed sessions (ADR 0007) with encrypted-opaque cookie carrying the row id.
  CSRF via double-submit cookie pair (`csrf_secret` on the row + `csrf` cookie + `x-csrf-token`
  header verified constant-time).
- **Where.** `lib/auth/session.ts`, `lib/auth/csrf.ts`, `lib/db/schema/sessions.ts`.
- **How.** The per-user **Active sessions** panel at `/profile#sessions` lists every browser
  cookie tied to your account with its IP, last-seen timestamp, and a revoke button. Admins
  manage other users' sessions from `/admin/users/<id>/sessions` (gated on `user.update`).

### 1.7 Rate limiting

- **What.** Token-bucket per IP for the login + sensitive endpoints. Bounded map size so a
  malicious peer can't OOM the rate-limiter map.
- **Where.** `lib/auth/rate-limit.ts`.
- **How.** Operator-tuneable thresholds live in the same module. Client IP for keys comes
  from the fronting proxy's `X-Forwarded-For`/`X-Real-IP` (`lib/client-ip.ts`); deploy behind a
  proxy that overwrites client-supplied XFF.

---

## 2. RBAC

### 2.1 Permissions vocabulary

- **What.** A typed list of ~60 permission strings spanning every action surface: zones,
  records, SOA, DNSSEC, metadata, TSIG, autoprimaries, templates, users, teams, roles, PDNS
  servers, API tokens, audit, settings, auth providers.
- **Where.** `lib/rbac/permissions.ts`.
- **How.** Use a permission in a route via `requireUser({ can: "zone.create" })` or in a page
  component via `requireUserForPage({ can: "zone.create" })`. The CASL ability builder
  (`lib/rbac/ability.ts`) enforces it.

### 2.2 System + custom roles

- **What.** Five system roles are seeded (`super-admin`, `team-owner`, `operator`,
  `zone-editor`, `read-only`). Custom roles are operator-defined via `/admin/roles` (gated on
  `role.create`).
- **Where.** `lib/rbac/default-roles.ts`, `lib/db/schema/roles.ts`,
  `app/(app)/admin/roles/`.
- **How.** Each role carries `permissions` (array of strings from the vocab) + `requires_mfa`
  (forces TOTP enrolment for any user assigned to this role).

  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="../screenshots/dark/roles.png" />
  <img src="../screenshots/light/roles.png" alt="Roles" width="720" />
</picture>

### 2.3 Zone-authority permissions

- **What.** The SOA, the apex NS RRset, and the zone-settings object are held apart from
  ordinary record editing, so a role can be given a zone's records without being given the
  zone. `soa.read` / `soa.update` gate the SOA tab; `record.update.apex-ns` is an extra
  requirement on top of `record.*` for writing the apex NS; `zone.settings.read` gates the
  Zone settings tab, whose writes stay on `zone.update`. Missing the read permission removes
  the tab outright rather than greying it out.
- **Where.** `lib/rbac/protected-rrsets.ts` (the classifier both sides share),
  `app/api/admin/pdns/zones/[zoneId]/rrsets/route.ts`,
  `app/api/admin/pdns/zones/[zoneId]/settings/route.ts`,
  `app/(app)/zones/[zoneId]/page.tsx`.
- **How.** The RRset route classifies every change by its normalized name before touching
  PowerDNS, so any client - the SOA panel, the record editor, or a hand-rolled `PATCH` - gets
  the same answer. The permissions work as per-zone grants too. See
  [docs/07-RBAC.md](./07-RBAC.md#splitting-record-editing-from-a-zones-authority).

### 2.4 Scoped assignments

- **What.** Every assignment is `(user, role, scope)` where scope is one of
  `global` / `team:<id>` / `zone:<fqdn>` / `server:<id>`. The CASL builder walks scopes at
  request time so an operator with `record.update` on `zone:example.com.` can edit records
  there but nowhere else.
- **Where.** `lib/rbac/ability.ts`, `lib/rbac/policy.ts`,
  `lib/db/schema/role-assignments.ts`, `lib/db/schema/zone-grants.ts`.
- **How.** Issue assignments from `/admin/users/<id>` (gated on `role.assign`) OR auto-issue
  via OIDC group mapping (see § 1.3). The `provider_id` column distinguishes admin-issued
  from OIDC-sourced; only OIDC-sourced ones get reconciled on sign-in.

---

## 3. PowerDNS backends

### 3.1 Multi-backend management

- **What.** The app fronts one or many PDNS Authoritative servers. Three topologies are
  supported and visible side-by-side:
  - **Standalone primary** - single instance, no replication.
  - **Primary + secondaries** - one writable, N read-only mirrors auto-bootstrapped via
    PDNS supermaster + NOTIFY/AXFR.
  - **Multi-primary cluster** - N writable peers sharing a replicated backend (e.g. Galera
    MariaDB). Cluster appears as ONE entry in every selector.
- **Where.** `lib/db/schema/pdns-servers.ts`, `lib/db/schema/pdns-clusters.ts`,
  `lib/db/repositories/{pdns-servers,pdns-clusters,selectable-backends}.ts`,
  `app/(app)/admin/{servers,pdns-clusters}/`.

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="../screenshots/dark/powerdns-servers.png" />
  <img src="../screenshots/light/powerdns-servers.png" alt="PowerDNS servers" width="720" />
</picture>

### 3.2 Per-cluster peer-selection strategy

- **What.** When operating on a cluster, both reads AND writes route to a peer chosen by the
  cluster's strategy:
  - `round_robin` - spread requests in order.
  - `random` - uniform random.
  - `lowest_latency` - peer with the lowest p50 from the sampler (falls back to round-robin
    until samples exist).
  - `least_load` - peer with the fewest zones from the sampler.
- **Where.** `lib/pdns/cluster-picker.ts`, `lib/pdns/cluster-picker-pure.ts`.
- **How.** Picked from the cluster edit page under **Peer selection strategy**. The column
  in the DB is `write_strategy` (legacy name preserved); the UI label is "Peer selection
  strategy" since it governs both reads and writes.

### 3.3 Read-only backends (write-mode override)

- **What.** A per-backend switch, **Never write to this backend (read-only)**, that removes it
  from every write path while leaving its zones fully browsable. Peer selection skips it, it
  can't be the default backend, and it renders with a `read-only` badge nested under its
  group's write target like a mirror.
- **Why it can't be derived.** Every other role signal in the app is observed from the daemon's
  `/config` (ADR-0014). This one can't be: a public nameserver serving **native** zones fed by
  **database replication** runs with `primary=no, secondary=no` - byte-identical to a standalone
  primary - yet its database user has no write access. PowerDNS exposes no flag for that, so
  without an override the peer picker rotates writes onto it and they fail (#109).
- **Where.** `pdns_servers.write_mode` (`auto` | `read_only`), the `isServerWriteTarget()` /
  `isReadOnlyBackend()` predicates in `lib/pdns/capabilities.ts`, enforced in
  `lib/db/repositories/{pdns-servers,pdns-clusters,selectable-backends}.ts`.
- **How.** Tick the box on the backend's edit page, or set `write_mode: read_only` on a server
  in provisioning YAML. Defaults to `auto`, so existing backends are unaffected.
- **Scope.** The override governs write routing only. AXFR topology derivation still reads the
  daemon's real capabilities, so marking a genuine AXFR primary read-only stops writes to it
  without breaking the secondaries that pull from it. See the 2026-07-22 amendment in
  [ADR-0014](./adr/0014-backend-capability-model.md).

> **Note.** "Use as the default backend" is a _different_ control - it only picks which backend
> serves a request that doesn't name one. It has never constrained peer selection within a group;
> use the read-only switch for that.

### 3.4 Sync probes

- **What.** Two flavours, identical visual shape:
  - **Primary + secondaries.** Compare each secondary's serial against the primary's;
    on-demand rrset diff for any zone that disagrees. Status chip in the zones table.
  - **Cluster.** Compare every peer's serial against the highest-serial peer (used as
    source-of-truth on disagreement, since there's no canonical primary). Same rrset diff
    on demand.
- **Where.** `lib/pdns/sync.ts`, `lib/pdns/cluster-sync.ts`,
  `app/(app)/zones/[zoneId]/_components/sync-section.tsx`.

### 3.5 NOTIFY-on-write + convergence sweep

- **What.** Every code path that creates a zone goes through `createZoneAndNotify()` which
  fires NOTIFY to all secondaries after the create. The provisioning loop additionally runs
  a convergence sweep after all demo zones are created - re-NOTIFYs every Master/Primary
  zone on each touched backend. This catches the docker-compose race where the first zones
  get created before secondaries have registered themselves as supermasters and miss the
  initial NOTIFY.
- **Where.** `lib/pdns/operations.ts`.

### 3.6 PDNS HTTP client

- **What.** Typed thin wrapper over PDNS's HTTP API: zones.list / get / create, rrsets PATCH,
  cryptokeys, metadata, TSIG, autoprimaries, server.info, statistics. Version cache +
  capability flags so feature gates (catalog zones, DNSSEC) reflect the real backend version.
  Retries with backoff, typed error hierarchy (`PdnsError` / `PdnsNotFoundError` /
  `PdnsConflictError`).
- **Where.** `lib/pdns/client.ts`, `lib/pdns/registry.ts`, `lib/pdns/types.ts`,
  `lib/pdns/errors.ts`.

### 3.7 PDNS request log

- **What.** Every HTTP call the app issues to PowerDNS is recorded with timestamp, server,
  operation, method, URL, response status, error (if any), and the correlator `requestId` of
  the audit row that triggered it. Visible at `/admin/requests` with filters for server,
  op, status code, request id, and date range. Each row expands inline to the full request +
  response detail; the `req:` link cross-pivots to / from the matching audit row, so an audit
  failure is one click from the exact PDNS exchange.
- **Where.** `lib/pdns/request-log.ts`, `app/(app)/admin/requests/`,
  `lib/db/repositories/pdns-requests.ts`.

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="../screenshots/dark/pdns-requests.png" />
  <img src="../screenshots/light/pdns-requests.png" alt="PDNS request log" width="720" />
</picture>

### 3.8 Backend health advisories

- **What.** A bell in the top header surfaces active advisories computed every poll cycle:
  unreachable backends, API-key rejections (401/403), replication drift past a threshold, TSIG
  keys missing on a secondary, mirror zones without `masters`, daemon-config drift between
  peers. Acknowledged advisories disappear automatically when the underlying condition
  resolves. Same signal feeds the per-row red/warn tints on
  [PowerDNS servers](#31-multi-backend-management) - bell and table never disagree.
- **Where.** `lib/health/evaluator.ts`, `components/domain/health-bell.tsx`,
  `lib/db/repositories/backend-advisories.ts`. Decision record:
  [ADR-0015](./adr/0015-backend-health-advisories.md).

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="../screenshots/dark/backend-health.png" />
  <img src="../screenshots/light/backend-health.png" alt="Backend health bell popover" width="720" />
</picture>

### 3.9 SSRF guard

- **What.** Config-time + runtime IP-range checks on PDNS `base_url`. Link-local
  (incl. 169.254.169.254 cloud metadata) is always blocked. Private networks gated by
  `APP_PDNS_ALLOW_PRIVATE_NETWORKS`; `http://` gated by `APP_PDNS_ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP`.
  At request time the guard re-resolves the host and **pins the validated IP into
  the connection**, so undici reaches the exact address the guard checked (closes
  the DNS-rebinding window).
- **Where.** `lib/pdns/url-safety.ts` (the guard); `lib/pdns/http.ts` (request-time
  re-check + pinned dispatcher).

### 3.10 Observed daemon capabilities

- **What.** Each backend carries a capability snapshot derived from its read-only `/config` on
  every daemon-meta probe: `api`, `primary`, `secondary`, `autosecondary`, the `launch` backends,
  DNSSEC, the configured autoprimary count, and `enable-lua-records`. The active ones render as
  tinted badges wherever a backend is listed; the allowlisted raw settings show verbatim under
  **Daemon settings** on the backend's detail page.
- **Lua records.** `enable-lua-records` (`no` | `yes` | `shared`) is in the snapshot because it
  decides whether the record editor offers the `LUA` type at all. LUA records are executable
  server-side code, so which daemons have it armed has to be visible from the backend list, not
  discoverable only by opening a zone and looking for the type in a dropdown. A daemon-level `no`
  is not a veto: per-zone `ENABLE-LUA-RECORDS` metadata still enables Lua for that one zone.
- **Freshness.** Badges reflect the last probe. After editing `pdns.conf`, re-probe the backend
  (**Admin → PowerDNS servers → Refresh**) - the same gesture that refreshes every other
  capability.
- **Where.** `lib/pdns/capabilities.ts`, `lib/pdns/config-advice.ts`,
  `components/domain/capability-badges.tsx`, `lib/realtime/backend-health.ts`.
  See [ADR-0014](./adr/0014-backend-capability-model.md).

---

## 4. Zones

### 4.1 Amalgamated zones list

- **What.** Every zone across every backend in one list. Per-row "Backend" column. Per-row
  Sync chip: "-" for standalones, "synced/desynced (N)" for primaries with secondaries and
  for clusters.
- **One row per zone identity** - `(horizon, name)`, see § 4.1.1. The same zone reached from a
  primary and its mirrors collapses to one row, resolved to the backend that owns it; anything
  genuinely collapsed is summarized in the "duplicate zones hidden" notice.
- **Where.** `app/(app)/zones/page.tsx`, `app/(app)/zones/_components/zones-table.tsx`,
  `lib/dns/zone-dedupe.ts`.

### 4.1.1 Split-horizon zones (public / internal)

- **What.** A per-zone **horizon** - "this is the internal copy" - set with a toggle at create time
  or later on the zone's **Zone settings** tab. An internal zone lists separately from a public zone
  of the same name, carries an `INTERNAL` badge next to the `CLUSTER` badge, and shows the badge on
  its detail page so it's unambiguous which copy is open before anyone edits a record. A
  Public / Internal filter appears above the list once the fleet has at least one internal zone.
- **Why.** Split-horizon DNS serves the same name differently inside and outside the network,
  usually from two daemons. Before this, the list keyed on the name alone, so the internal copy
  vanished into the "duplicate zones hidden" notice - a deliberate setup reported as an accident of
  replication (#121).
- **How.** App-side classification (PowerDNS cannot tell the two apart), stored sparsely in
  `zone_horizons` and scoped to the backend - to the **cluster** for a cluster zone, so it doesn't
  flicker as peer selection rotates. Unclassified means `public`, so nothing changes for installs
  that don't use it. A mirror of a managed primary inherits that primary's classification. Changes
  are audited as `zone.horizon.update`; deleting a zone drops its classification.
- **Scope.** Presentation and grouping only - it never changes what PowerDNS serves, and it is not
  PDNS 5.0 Views (which splits horizons _within_ one daemon; complementary, not superseded).
- **Where.** `lib/dns/zone-horizon.ts`, `lib/dns/zone-dedupe.ts`,
  `lib/db/{schema,repositories}/zone-horizons.ts`, `components/domain/zone-horizon-badge.tsx`.
  See [ADR-0022](./adr/0022-zone-horizons.md).

  <img src="../screenshots/light/zones-list.png" alt="Amalgamated zones list" width="720" />
</picture>

### 4.2 Per-RRset editor with diff-before-apply

- **What.** Edit records inline; the editor batches changes into a single transactional PATCH
  to PDNS with an audit row carrying full before/after JSONB snapshots. Every change runs
  through a **Review changes** modal that previews the BIND-style before/after diff - Save is
  the second click, never the first.
- **Where.** `app/(app)/zones/[zoneId]/_components/editable-record-table.tsx`,
  `app/api/admin/pdns/zones/[zoneId]/rrsets/route.ts`.
- **How.** Per-RR-type validators live in `lib/validators/rr-types/` and run on every change
  pair. Hard-error for shape/range violations; soft-warn for deprecated-but-legal options
  (DS digest-type 1, SSHFP DSA, SVCB unknown SvcParamKey, etc.). Hard errors are gated by an
  explicit **Save anyway** checkbox so an override is always intentional and audited verbatim.

### 4.3 Zone clone

- **What.** Copy a zone's rrsets into a new zone name on the same backend. The new zone
  ships with the original's records (sans SOA, which PDNS regenerates).
- **Where.** `app/api/admin/pdns/zones/clone/route.ts`, `lib/pdns/clone.ts`.

### 4.4 Zone templates

- **What.** Reusable scaffolding for new zones: NS records, SOA timers, prelude records,
  zone-object settings (`soa_edit`, `soa_edit_api`, `api_rectify`), per-kind metadata bag.
  Templates can be `default_for_primary_slugs` so the create-zone form preselects them when
  the operator picks one of the listed backends.
- **Where.** `lib/db/schema/zone-templates.ts`, `lib/validators/zone-templates.ts`,
  `app/(app)/admin/zone-templates/`.

### 4.5 Zone change history

- **What.** Per-zone history feed at `/zones/<id>?tab=history` rendering every audit event
  with diff (rrset before/after) and one-line summaries for DNSSEC / metadata events. Chip
  colours match the action vocabulary's tone (`lib/audit/action-color.ts`).
- **Where.** `app/(app)/zones/[zoneId]/_components/zone-change-log.tsx`.

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="../screenshots/dark/zone-change-history.png" />
  <img src="../screenshots/light/zone-change-history.png" alt="Zone change history" width="720" />
</picture>

---

## 5. DNSSEC

- **What.** Cryptokey create / update / delete with per-key activity timestamps derived from
  the audit log. Summary card + per-key list at `/zones/<id>?tab=dnssec`.
- **Where.** `app/(app)/zones/[zoneId]/_components/dnssec-section.tsx`,
  `app/api/admin/pdns/zones/[zoneId]/cryptokeys/`.

---

## 6. Zone metadata

- **What.** Per-kind GET / PUT / DELETE under `/api/admin/pdns/zones/[zoneId]/metadata/[kind]`.
  Surfaced as `<MetadataEventLine>` entries on the zone change-history feed.
- **Where.** `app/(app)/zones/[zoneId]/_components/metadata-section.tsx`,
  `app/api/admin/pdns/zones/[zoneId]/metadata/`.

---

## 7. TSIG keys

- **What.** Manage shared-secret keys for AXFR + DDNS. Permission model splits `tsig.read`
  (list-only - name + algorithm) from `tsig.manage` (create / regenerate / reveal / delete)
  so an operator can audit the inventory without ever seeing the secret material.
- **Where.** `lib/pdns/tsigkeys.ts`, `app/(app)/admin/tsig-keys/`.

## 8. Autoprimaries

- **What.** Configure supermaster registrations on a secondary PDNS so it auto-creates zones
  on NOTIFY from a registered primary.
- **Where.** `lib/pdns/autoprimaries.ts`, `app/(app)/admin/servers/[id]/_components/autoprimaries-panel.tsx`.

## 9. Audit log

- **What.** Append-only log of every state-changing operation. Each row carries actor, action,
  resource, optional before/after JSONB snapshots, request context (IP, user-agent, request
  id), and a timestamp. Snapshots are auto-redacted for known secret field names.
- **Where.** `lib/audit/log.ts`, `lib/audit/actions.ts` (typed vocab), `lib/audit/redact.ts`,
  `app/(app)/admin/audit/`.
- **How.** Filter by actor, action, resource, time range from `/admin/audit` (gated on
  `audit.read`). Per-resource "Last admin edit" columns on every admin list page are derived
  from one batched query. Quick-filter chips cover the common incident-response queries
  (failed sign-ins, MFA admin changes, session revocations). Every row that originated a PDNS
  call carries a `req:` link that pivots to the matching rows in
  [the PDNS request log](#37-pdns-request-log), and CSV export honours the active filters.

## 10. Settings

- **What.** Operator-tunable runtime values: site name, support contact, login intro text,
  brand logo (https:// URL or inline data: URI), failed-login lockout policy.
- **Where.** `lib/validators/settings.ts`, `app/(app)/admin/settings/`,
  `lib/settings/app-settings.ts`.

## 11. Dashboard

- **What.** At-a-glance widgets for operator attention surfaces:
  - **Users** - locked-out, no-MFA, unverified, must-change-password counts.
  - **PDNS backends** - never probed, stale > 24h.
  - **OIDC providers** - never probed, failing.

  Widgets are hidden when zero, so the dashboard stays quiet during steady-state.

- **Where.** `app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx`,
  `lib/db/repositories/dashboard.ts`.

## 12. Provisioning (first-boot YAML)

- **What.** A YAML file applied on first boot writes the operator's declarative state into the
  database: settings, custom roles, teams, zone templates, PDNS clusters, PDNS servers, demo
  zones, OIDC providers (with group mappings). The applier writes a `settings.provisioned_at`
  sentinel on success; subsequent restarts skip the file.
- **Where.** `lib/provisioning/schema.ts` (Zod schema), `lib/provisioning/apply.ts`,
  `provisioning.example.yaml` (exhaustive reference).
- **How.** Set `PROVISIONING_FILE=/etc/.../provisioning.yaml` in the env, drop the file at
  that path, restart. To re-provision an existing database, delete the
  `settings.provisioned_at` row and restart.

---

## 13. Email / SMTP

- **What.** Optional transactional mail. With `SMTP_HOST` unset, `sendEmail()` no-ops with
  `{ ok: true, skipped: true }`. With it set, three encryption shapes are supported:
  implicit TLS (`SMTP_SECURE=true`), STARTTLS required, STARTTLS opportunistic (default), or
  plaintext-only for local fakemail. AUTH is optional - omit `SMTP_USERNAME` + `SMTP_PASSWORD`
  for a relay that allow-lists this app's source IP.
- **Where.** `lib/email/transport.ts`, `lib/email/send.ts`, env validation in `lib/env.ts`.

---

## 14. Realtime

- **What.** SSE event bus that the zone list + zone detail subscribe to so external edits show
  up without a manual refresh. Backed by a single in-process zone-state poller; per-request
  PDNS calls are eliminated.
- **Where.** `lib/realtime/event-bus.ts`, `lib/realtime/zone-poller.ts`,
  `lib/realtime/zone-state-cache.ts`.

---

## 15. Observability

- **What.**
  - **Logs.** Pino structured JSON; secret-field redaction via `lib/errors/redact.ts`.
  - **Metrics.** Prometheus `/metrics` (optional bearer-token gate via `METRICS_TOKEN`).
  - **Health.** `/healthz` (liveness) + `/readyz` (readiness - fails on DB unreachable or
    pending migrations).
- **Where.** `lib/logger.ts`, `app/metrics/`, `app/healthz/`, `app/readyz/`.

---

## 16. Deployment

### 16.1 Single image

- **What.** One Docker image, no external CDN. Migrations run in the entrypoint at boot
  (ADR 0011); on Postgres they're serialized by `pg_advisory_lock` so multi-replica boots are
  safe. `MIGRATE_ON_BOOT=false` opts out for CI/CD-driven migration workflows.
- **Where.** `Dockerfile`, `docker/entrypoint.mjs`, `scripts/migrate.ts`.

### 16.2 Compose stacks

All stacks use the official `powerdns/pdns-auth` image - there is no custom PowerDNS build.

- `docker-compose.yml` - the **minimal-demo stack**: SQLite app (published
  `ghcr.io/powerdns-authadmin/powerdns-authadmin` image) + a bundled standalone PowerDNS, pre-seeded with 10 demo
  zones (via `provisioning.minimal-demo.yaml`). The fastest way to try it.
- `docker-compose-primary-secondaries.yml` - primary + three secondaries with supermaster
  auto-bootstrap.
- `docker-compose-multi-primary.yml` - three writable peers sharing MariaDB.
- `docker-compose-combined.yml` - all three topologies in one stack with seeded demo zones.

### 16.3 Storage

Postgres (recommended) and SQLite both supported. Schema lives in parallel
`lib/db/schema/` (pg) + `lib/db/schema-sqlite/` directories. Each emits its own migration
folder (`drizzle/`, `drizzle-sqlite/`); the boot entrypoint picks one based on
`DATABASE_URL`'s scheme.

---

## 17. Security posture

- **Per-request CSP nonce** (ADR 0006) so injected `<script>` tags don't execute.
- **CSRF double-submit** on every mutating route via `requireCsrf(request)`.
- **SSRF guard** on PDNS base URLs (§ 3.9).
- **Encryption envelope** for at-rest secrets - versioned AES-256-GCM via HKDF-SHA-256
  subkeys per usage (`lib/crypto/encryption.ts`).
- **Secret-field redaction** in audit `before`/`after` snapshots and free-form log strings.
- **Argon2id** with OWASP 2024 parameters for passwords and API tokens.
- **No telemetry phone-home.** Air-gapped enterprises are first-class.
- **`SECURITY.md`** for the vulnerability disclosure policy.

---

## 18. API

- Every admin surface has a corresponding `/api/admin/...` route handler. Routes accept
  either a session cookie (UI clients) or `Authorization: Bearer pda_pat_…` /
  `X-API-Key: pda_pat_…` (API clients).
- Mutating routes require `x-csrf-token`. The client wrapper `lib/client/api-fetch.ts` adds
  it automatically; programmatic clients omit it when authenticating via a PAT (the PAT itself
  proves the request is intentional).
- The full route surface mirrors the admin UI - see `app/api/admin/` and `app/api/profile/`.

---

## 19. Operator UX & responsive design

Landed in v1.1.4 ([#51](https://github.com/PowerDNS-AuthAdmin/powerdns-authadmin/issues/51) /
[PR #52](https://github.com/PowerDNS-AuthAdmin/powerdns-authadmin/pull/52)) - a top-to-bottom
pass to make the operator surface usable on phones without giving up the dense desktop
information density. Every screenshot in [`screenshots/`](../screenshots/README.md) is from
this baseline.

### 19.1 Mobile-first responsive shell

- **What.** Off-canvas hamburger drawer for navigation under `md`; full sidebar from `md+`.
  Drawer closes on backdrop tap, Esc, and route changes (no in-drawer close button needed).
  The top bar reflows: hamburger + status chip + bell + theme + avatar, all reachable at
  320 px.
- **Where.** `components/ui/app-shell.tsx`, `app/(app)/layout.tsx`.

</p>

### 19.2 One DataTable, every list

- **What.** Every list view (zones, users, roles, teams, OIDC providers, TSIG keys,
  autoprimaries, zone templates, audit log, PDNS request log, sessions, profile sessions,
  servers, dashboard sub-tables, role assignments, team members, zone change history) uses
  the same `<DataTable>` recipe. Desktop: `bg-bg-muted` thead, `even:bg-bg-subtle` striping,
  accent-tinted hover wash, sticky search + sort + per-column meta widths. Mobile (< md):
  each row reflows to a labelled card automatically - no horizontal scroll, no truncated
  cells.
- **Where.** `components/ui/data-table.tsx`. The Audit Log + Profile Sessions + OIDC
  Providers + TSIG Keys + Autoprimaries were the final hold-outs converted in v1.1.4.

### 19.3 Live header status chip

- **What.** Single pill in the top bar showing `CONNECTING / CONNECTED / OFFLINE / PAUSED`
  (SSE connection state) plus a trailing `· SYNCED / · DESYNCED` whenever the page has a
  notion of sync state. Off-the-shelf default is the fleet-wide `globalAnyLagging()` verdict
  computed from the in-process zone-state cache (no extra PDNS hit); per-page
  `<HeaderStatusMode/>` overrides on zone-detail, zones-list, and the servers page. A 5 s
  grace prevents "OFFLINE" flashes on Ctrl-R.
- **Where.** `components/realtime/header-status-chip.tsx`,
  `components/realtime/realtime-provider.tsx`, `lib/pdns/sync.ts` (`globalAnyLagging`).

### 19.4 Animated SyncIndicator

- **What.** Concentric-ring SVG glyph used everywhere a sync verdict is displayed (header
  chip, zones list per-row chip, servers table). **Synced** = solid centre + two
  outward-pulsing rings via staggered CSS keyframes - a continuous radar/sonar ping.
  **Desynced** = hollow centre + two dashed concentric rings that counter-rotate via
  `stroke-dashoffset` so the icon reads as _actively trying_ rather than as a frozen error.
  Honours `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Where.** `components/ui/sync-indicator.tsx`, `app/globals.css` (`pda-sync-pulse` +
  `pda-desync-spin*` keyframes).

### 19.5 One-button theme toggle

- **What.** Was three buttons (sun / monitor / moon). Now one button whose icon mirrors the
  active preference and cycles `light → dark → system → light` on click. The pre-hydration
  script in `app/layout.tsx` still applies the `.dark` class before React mounts so there's
  no flash of wrong theme.
- **Where.** `components/ui/theme-toggle.tsx`.

### 19.6 Capability badges + clickable rows

- **What.** Per-backend badges (`CLUSTER` / `DEFAULT` / `PRIMARY` / `READ-ONLY MIRROR`) match
  the visual vocabulary across servers, zones, audit. Every table row + mobile card is
  clickable to the detail view; embedded links/buttons (Edit / Delete / Refresh) intercept the
  click so per-row actions still work.
- **Where.** `components/domain/capability-badges.tsx`, `components/ui/clickable-row.tsx`.

### 19.7 Diff-before-apply (record edits)

The per-RRset editor now insists on a **Review changes** modal between Save and the actual
PATCH - see [§ 4.2](#42-per-rrset-editor-with-diff-before-apply) for the full story. Validation
errors are gated behind an explicit "Save anyway" checkbox so an override is never accidental.

### 19.8 Compliance hard-stops

- **What.** Operators with `must_change_password = true` or unmet MFA-per-role requirements
  are pinned to `/profile` (or an allow-list of self-service routes) on every navigation -
  not just the initial render. The header status chip is suppressed in that state because
  the SSE endpoint would 403 the request, which would otherwise leave the chip stuck on
  `CONNECTING`.
- **Where.** `lib/auth/require-user.ts` (page gate), `app/(app)/layout.tsx` (compliance
  redirect), `components/auth/must-change-password-guard.tsx` (client-side intercept).
