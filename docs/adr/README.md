# Architecture Decision Records

> **Why these exist.** Code preserves the _what_ but rots the _why_. ADRs preserve the _why_ so a
> future contributor can ask "why did they do it this way?" and get an answer without archaeology.

## How to use them

- **Read** any ADR whose subject touches the area you're changing before you change it.
- **Write** a new ADR when you make a decision that:
  - Adds, removes, or replaces a major dependency.
  - Changes an architectural pattern.
  - Constrains future choices in a non-obvious way.
- **Don't edit** ADRs after they're merged. Write a follow-up ADR that supersedes the old one
  (and update the old one's `Status` to `Superseded by NNNN`).

## Format

Copy `0000-template.md`. Keep ADRs short - one page is the target, two is the max. The point is
durability, not exhaustiveness.

> **Note:** ADR-0001 records the original choice of Next.js 15; the project has since upgraded to
> Next.js 16 (same App Router + RSC architecture). See the update note in that ADR.
