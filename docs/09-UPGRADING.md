# Upgrading

PowerDNS-AuthAdmin ships as a single image and runs its own database migrations on
boot, so upgrading is usually "pull a new tag and recreate the container." This
page covers doing it safely.

## Before you upgrade

1. **Read the [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md)** for the target version - note any
   breaking changes.
2. **Back up the database** (and your `APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`):
   - SQLite: copy the DB file / snapshot the data volume.
   - Postgres: `pg_dump`.
     See [Installation → Backups](./02-INSTALLATION.md#backups).
3. **Pin a version tag** in production rather than `:latest`, so deploys are
   deterministic and you know exactly what you're moving from and to.

## Upgrade

```sh
docker compose pull         # fetch the new image tag
docker compose up -d        # recreate the app container
docker compose logs -f app  # watch migrations apply
```

On boot the entrypoint runs migrations, then the seed (idempotent), then any
provisioning (skipped after first boot), then starts the server. Migration logs
are intentionally loud - you'll see the pending list and the applied names. If a
migration fails, **the container refuses to start** rather than running on a
half-migrated schema; fix the cause and restart.

## Verify

- `GET /readyz` returns 200 once migrations match the expected version.
- Sign in; check **Admin → PowerDNS servers** shows backends **Reachable**, and
  the dashboard has no unexpected attention banners.

## Version-specific notes

### Upgrading to 1.5.6 (from 1.5.5)

**No schema change**, but there IS a migration -
`0007_granular_zone_permissions_backfill` is data-only: it rewrites permission
lists, adds no tables and no columns. Pull and recreate:

```sh
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs app | grep migrate   # expect 0007_… in the applied list
```

**What changed.** Editing a zone's records and editing the zone itself are no
longer the same permission. `soa.read` / `soa.update` gate the SOA tab,
`zone.settings.read` gates the Zone settings tab (writing it stays
`zone.update`), and `record.update.apex-ns` is now required - on top of the
matching `record.*` - to write the zone's apex NS. Missing a read permission
hides the tab outright. See
[RBAC → Splitting record editing from a zone's authority](./07-RBAC.md#splitting-record-editing-from-a-zones-authority).

**Your own roles keep working.** The migration backfills every operator-defined
role, zone grant and API token that held the permission which used to imply the
new one:

| Held before          | Gains                            |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `zone.read`          | `soa.read`, `zone.settings.read` |
| `record.update`      | `soa.update`                     |
| any `record.*` write | `record.update.apex-ns`          |

An API token with an EMPTY scope list is untouched - empty already means
"everything the user currently holds". Nothing you have configured loses access
on upgrade; tightening a role is now an edit you make deliberately, by
unticking `soa.update` (and `record.update.apex-ns`, and `zone.settings.read`)
on it.

**The seeded system roles DO change**, because they are re-upserted from
`lib/rbac/default-roles.ts` on every boot:

- **Zone Editor** loses `soa.update` and `record.update.apex-ns`. It keeps
  `soa.read` and `zone.settings.read`, so both tabs stay visible, read-only.
  This is the role to assign a hosting customer.
- **Operator** and above gain both, alongside the `zone.update` they already
  held.

If you rely on Zone Editor being able to rewrite the SOA, copy it to a custom
role with `soa.update` ticked and reassign - system-role permissions can't be
edited in place by design.

**Rolling back.** 1.5.5 has the same schema, so a downgrade is a straight image
swap. The backfilled permissions simply become strings 1.5.5 doesn't recognise
(the ability builder logs and skips unknown names), and the old implicit
behaviour returns.

### Upgrading to 1.5.5 (from 1.5.4)

**No schema change** - nothing to watch in the boot log beyond the usual
"no pending migrations". Pull and recreate:

```sh
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

**If you have imported zonefiles before, check what landed.** Every version up
to and including 1.5.4 stripped parentheses out of quoted record data on import
and collapsed runs of whitespace inside quoted strings, silently and without a
diagnostic. PowerDNS LUA records are the ones to look at first - a Lua
expression is nothing but function calls, so `"ifportup(443, {...})"` was stored
as `"ifportup 443, {...} "` and does not work. Quoted TXT values containing
parentheses were affected the same way.

Re-importing an affected zone on 1.5.5 parses it correctly, so the fix for a
mangled record is to re-import from the original zonefile (or fix the record by
hand in the editor). Nothing is rewritten automatically on upgrade - AuthAdmin
has no way to tell a corrupted value from one an operator meant to type.

**LUA records now need Lua enabled on the backend to import.** Zonefile import
previously skipped the `enable-lua-records` check that the record editor
enforces. If you import a zonefile containing `LUA` records onto a backend
without `enable-lua-records` set, that zone now fails with an explanatory
message instead of silently creating records PowerDNS will not serve. Other
zones in the same import are unaffected.

**Rolling back.** 1.5.4 has the same schema, so a downgrade is a straight image
swap - though it reintroduces the import corruption.

### Upgrading to 1.5.4 (from 1.5.3)

**This release adds a table** - `zone_horizons`, for the new split-horizon zone
classification. It's the first schema change since 1.5.0, so unlike the last few
upgrades there is a migration to watch:

```sh
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f app   # expect: 0006_nice_butterfly (Postgres) or
                             #         0006_petite_the_santerians (SQLite)
```

The migration creates an empty table and touches nothing else - no existing row
is read, rewritten, or locked, so it applies in milliseconds on any size of
install. On Postgres the entrypoint takes a `pg_advisory_lock` first, so
multi-replica deployments serialize their boots as usual.

**Rolling back.** 1.5.3 doesn't know about `zone_horizons` and never queries it,
so a downgrade works: the table sits unused and your classifications are still
there if you roll forward again. The boot log will show one more applied
migration than that version's journal expects, which is logged but not treated
as an error (the migrator only refuses to start on _pending_ migrations, never
on extra ones). Drop the table manually only if you're sure you won't roll
forward.

Everything else is a pull-and-recreate:

- **Split-horizon zones.** Nothing to configure - every existing zone is
  `public`, exactly as it behaved before. Tick **This is an internal zone** on a
  zone's **Zone settings** tab (or when adding one) to classify it; the zones
  list then shows an internal and a public zone of the same name as separate
  rows instead of hiding one as a duplicate.
- **Lua capability badge.** Backends now show a `lua records` badge when
  `enable-lua-records` is on. It reads from the cached capability snapshot, so
  after changing `pdns.conf` re-probe the backend (**Admin → PowerDNS servers →
  Refresh**) for the badge - and the record editor's `LUA` type - to update. Any
  backend probed before this upgrade shows nothing until its next probe.
- `js-yaml` 4.3.1 and `postcss` 8.5.25 for the advisories noted in the
  [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md#154---2026-08-08).

### Upgrading to 1.5.3 (from 1.5.2)

No migration and no code change to your data - pull the new tag and recreate the
container. Adds PowerDNS Lua record editing (only where the daemon has Lua
enabled) and bumps `next` to 16.2.12 and `postcss` to 8.5.18 for the advisories
noted in the [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md#153---2026-07-26).

To use Lua records, enable them on the PowerDNS host - either globally with
`enable-lua-records` in `pdns.conf`, or per zone with
`pdnsutil set-meta <zone> ENABLE-LUA-RECORDS 1`. AuthAdmin cannot set that flag
itself (PowerDNS does not expose it for writing over the API) and reflects
whichever you chose.

### Upgrading to 1.5.2 (from 1.5.1)

No migration and no code change - pull the new tag and recreate the container.
Pins `sharp` forward to `^0.35.3` to clear the inherited libvips CVEs in
[GHSA-f88m-g3jw-g9cj](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f88m-g3jw-g9cj).

### Upgrading to 1.5.1 (from 1.5.0)

No migration, no schema change, no config change - pull the new tag and
recreate the container. Fixes three defects that predate 1.5.0: **Test
connection** crashing the result panel on a reachable backend, the favicon
rendering inconsistently in Safari, and recurring `/favicon.ico` prerender-cache
errors in the container logs.

### Upgrading to 1.5.0 (from 1.4.3)

One additive migration, no breaking changes - pull the new tag and recreate the
container as above. The migration adds `pdns_servers.write_mode` with a default of
`auto`, so every existing backend keeps its current behaviour and no backend
becomes read-only on its own.

Act on this release only if you run a **hidden primary whose zones are `Native`
and replicate to public nameservers through the database** rather than AXFR. Those
public nodes are indistinguishable from standalone primaries over the PowerDNS
API, so until now the peer-selection strategy could route writes to them and the
read-only database user would reject the change. Open each public node under
**Admin → PowerDNS servers**, tick **Never write to this backend (read-only)**,
and save - writes then land only on the primary. In provisioning YAML the
equivalent is `write_mode: read_only` on the server row.

Every other topology needs no action.

This release also bumps `js-yaml`, `dompurify`, and `brace-expansion` to clear
open advisories, and tightens the OIDC icon-URL preview in the admin form. See
the [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md#150---2026-07-22) for the impact assessment on
each.

### Upgrading to 1.4.3 (from 1.4.2)

No migration and no breaking changes - pull the new tag and recreate the
container as above. The release improves TSIG key workflows by showing and
editing zone correlations on TSIG keys, selecting eligible keys when creating or
importing Primary / Master zones, and applying import-time transfer keys through
the same primary-plus-secondaries validation used by Add Zone.

`SETTINGS_RO=true` now also blocks Settings Backup & Restore. Export and restore
return 403 from the API while the UI shows the read-only lock and disables the
download, upload, and restore controls. Normal deployments with `SETTINGS_RO`
unset keep existing behaviour.

### Upgrading to 1.4.2 (from 1.4.1)

No migration, no breaking changes, and no config or permission changes - pull the
new tag and recreate the container as above. The release only swaps the in-app
favicon to the static `{}` SVG the marketing site uses so the browser-tab icon
matches; nothing operational changes.

### Upgrading to 1.4.1 (from 1.4.0)

No migration and no breaking changes - pull the new tag and recreate the container
as above. The release fixes create-zone template auto-selection for clustered /
grouped primaries, clarifies the backend picker's group label, and adds an opt-in
Settings read-only lock.

#### Optional - lock the Settings page for public demos (`SETTINGS_RO`)

If you run a **publicly-reachable demo** where visitors may hold a settings-capable
role, set `SETTINGS_RO=true` to make the entire admin Settings page read-only: every
runtime-mutable setting is frozen and `PATCH /api/admin/settings` returns 403 even
for holders of `settings.write`. Leave it unset (`false`, the default) for normal
deployments - existing behaviour is unchanged. It needs no companion variable.

### Upgrading to 1.4.0 (from 1.3.x)

No migration and no breaking changes - pull the new tag and recreate the
container as above. The release adds an opt-in demo guard rail and dashboard
fixes.

#### Optional - lock the bootstrap admin for public demos (`BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_RO`)

If you run a **publicly-reachable demo** with a published login, set
`BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_RO=true` (and make sure `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL` is set). This
freezes that account's own password, email, name, MFA / passkey, enable/disable,
delete, and role assignments, so a visitor can't hijack or lock out the shared
login. It changes nothing else the account can do. Leave it unset (`false`, the
default) for normal deployments - existing behaviour is unchanged. When enabled,
the seed provisions the account already password-compliant, so the first login
isn't trapped on a change-password screen it can never clear.

### Upgrading to 1.3.0 (from 1.2.x)

A **feature-pile release**: WebAuthn (passkeys, primary + 2FA), SAML 2.0 SP,
LDAP direct-bind, teams per-zone grants, session-scoped IdP-derived
permissions with live token recompute, the unified `/admin/authentication`
admin surface, and a super-admin Backup & Restore wizard. The migration is a
single SQL file per dialect (`drizzle/0004_low_luminals.sql` +
`drizzle-sqlite/0004_black_storm.sql`) and runs automatically at app boot -
no manual schema steps.

The items below need operator attention.

#### Permission rename - `oidc.*` → `auth.*`

The `oidc.read` / `oidc.manage` permission strings are renamed to `auth.read` /
`auth.manage` since the same gates now cover OIDC, SAML, and LDAP at the
unified `/admin/authentication` surface.

**What the migration does for you**: existing `roles.permissions` arrays are
rewritten in place - every `"oidc.read"` becomes `"auth.read"`, every
`"oidc.manage"` becomes `"auth.manage"`. Seeded system roles + custom
operator-defined roles both get the update.

**What you need to do**: nothing in the typical case. If you provision roles
declaratively via `provisioning.yaml`, update your YAML to use the new
permission names - the applier won't fail on the old names, but they'll be
silently dropped (they're no longer in the master vocabulary).

#### Admin URL renames - `/admin/oidc-providers` → `/admin/authentication/oidc`

| Old                          | New                               |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `/admin/oidc-providers`      | `/admin/authentication/oidc`      |
| `/admin/oidc-providers/<id>` | `/admin/authentication/oidc/<id>` |
| `/admin/saml-providers`      | `/admin/authentication/saml`      |
| `/admin/saml-providers/<id>` | `/admin/authentication/saml/<id>` |
| `/admin/ldap-providers`      | `/admin/authentication/ldap`      |
| `/admin/ldap-providers/<id>` | `/admin/authentication/ldap/<id>` |

Every old URL keeps a server-side redirect to the new one, so external links,
bookmarks, and audit-log references continue to resolve. Update your own docs
and runbooks at your leisure. The internal API routes
(`/api/admin/oidc-providers/...` etc.) are **not** moved - they're a stable
contract for external automation.

#### IdP-derived permissions move from `role_assignments` to `sessions`

**The breaking-ish bit**: rows in `role_assignments` tagged with `provider_id`
(i.e. they came from an OIDC group-sync) are deleted by the migration. They
re-materialise into the user's new `sessions.derived_permissions` JSONB column
on their **next sign-in**.

**Why**: persisting IdP-derived rows left stale state for users removed from
groups who never signed in again. The new model keeps a derived-perms snapshot
on the session row; tokens live-recompute against the IdP at use time (LDAP
service-account search, OIDC refresh-token → userinfo) bounded by
`IDP_PERMS_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` (default 60s) or fall back to the latest session
snapshot up to `TOKEN_IDP_FALLBACK_TTL_SECONDS` (default 24h) when the IdP
can't be reached. See issue #85 for the full design.

**What operators experience**:

- Local-auth users: nothing changes.
- SSO users with an active session at upgrade time: the session keeps its
  admin-issued permissions. They temporarily lose IdP-derived perms until they
  sign in again, which re-materialises the snapshot. Sign-out / sign-in once
  after the upgrade.
- SSO users with API tokens: same - token use falls back to admin-issued perms
  until the user re-signs-in (then within 60s the live recompute kicks in for
  LDAP / OIDC sessions).

**New env vars** (both optional, sensible defaults):

```env
# How old the latest session's IdP-derived snapshot may be before tokens drop
# the IdP-derived slice (default 24h).
TOKEN_IDP_FALLBACK_TTL_SECONDS=86400

# Cache window for the live IdP-perms recompute (LDAP/OIDC). Lower → tighter
# freshness, more IdP load. Default 60s.
IDP_PERMS_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS=60
```

#### OIDC sessions: enable `offline_access` for live token recompute

To get the OIDC live-recompute path (refresh-token → userinfo at API-token use
time), the IdP must include `offline_access` in the scope on the authorization
request - already the default for new OIDC providers configured under
`/admin/authentication/oidc`. **Existing OIDC sessions created before the
upgrade have no refresh token stored**; their tokens use the session-snapshot
fallback until the user signs in fresh. Existing OIDC operators should sign
out + sign in once after the upgrade to enjoy the live-recompute path.

#### Session TTL is now bounds-checked

`SESSION_TTL_SECONDS` is clamped to `[300, 2592000]` (5 minutes – 30 days) at
boot. If you'd set a value outside that window (almost certainly a typo), the
app now refuses to start with a clear error rather than silently logging
everyone out or accumulating session rows without a ceiling. Default is
unchanged (43200 = 12h).

#### Audit-action vocabulary changes

| Old                                       | New                                  |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `auth.oidc.group_sync.assignment_added`   | _removed_ (no per-row events now)    |
| `auth.oidc.group_sync.assignment_removed` | _removed_                            |
| `auth.oidc.group_sync.mapping_unresolved` | `auth.group_sync.mapping_unresolved` |
| `auth.oidc.linked`                        | `auth.idp.linked`                    |
| `auth.oidc.rejected_provisioning`         | `auth.idp.rejected_provisioning`     |
| `auth.saml.linked`                        | `auth.idp.linked`                    |
| `auth.saml.rejected_provisioning`         | `auth.idp.rejected_provisioning`     |
| `auth.ldap.rejected_provisioning`         | `auth.idp.rejected_provisioning`     |

Existing audit rows are **untouched** - old action names stay on the rows
written under them. The change only affects new rows. Audit dashboards that
filter on the old names should be updated.

#### Backup & Restore (super-admin only)

A new **Backup & Restore** wizard at `/admin/settings/backup` exposes a JSON
export of the app DB **and** a merge-mode restore (insert-missing-rows only,
guarded by a typed confirmation phrase). Permission: the new `system.backup`,
default-granted only to the seeded `super-admin` role. The export excludes
PDNS zone data and the symmetric secrets (`APP_SECRET_KEY` /
`APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`); encrypted columns export as ciphertext, useless without
the encryption key on the restore target.

#### Zone Import / Export

A new **Import / Export** hub at `/admin/import-export` (under PowerDNS →
Zones) lets operators paste/upload BIND zonefiles to create zones in bulk, and
download selected zones as a single BIND-format bundle. `zone.read` to view,
`zone.create` to import. No operator action required - it's additive.

### Upgrading to 1.2.1 (from 1.2.x)

A **build-pipeline patch** - drop-in upgrade. No schema, no API, no
operator-config changes. Pull-and-recreate the container:

```sh
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

What changes:

- **Image is significantly smaller.** ~1.18 GB → ~290 MB local
  (-75%); the compressed pull from GHCR drops from ~225 MB to ~80 MB
  (-65%). Pull time on a rolling deploy drops accordingly.
- **No `tsx`, no `/app/scripts/`, `/app/lib/`, or `/app/tsconfig.json`
  in the runtime image.** Boot stages run pre-bundled ESM files under
  `/app/boot/{migrate,seed,provision}.js`.
- **Runner is now distroless.** Base swapped from
  `node:24-bookworm-slim` to `gcr.io/distroless/nodejs24-debian12:nonroot`.
  No shell, no apt, no package manager in the runtime image - only
  `node`, glibc, openssl, ca-certificates.
- **Container user is `nonroot` (uid 65532)**, replacing `node`
  (uid 1000).
- **Next.js built-in image optimizer is disabled** (`images.unoptimized: true`);
  `<Image>` tags still render at intrinsic size.
- **`:latest` follows releases**, not `main`. `:edge` tracks `main`.
  See [Installation → Image tags](./02-INSTALLATION.md#image-tags).

> **NOTE - operator-facing trade-offs (read before upgrading a
> production deployment):**
>
> 1.  **No shell in the runtime container.** `docker exec <id> sh` is
>     unavailable; the distroless base ships only the Node binary.
>     For incident triage that needs a shell, build a `:debug` tag
>     against the same builder stage with a bookworm-slim runner.
>     Day-to-day operations (logs, `/healthz`, `/readyz`, env reload,
>     image upgrades) are unaffected.
> 2.  **Container user changed from `node` (uid 1000) to `nonroot`
>     (uid 65532).** If you'd manually chown'd a host-mounted `/data`
>     volume to uid 1000 prior, re-chown it to 65532 before the first
>     boot of v1.2.1. The compose examples shipped in this repo don't
>     pin a uid and need no change.

If you mounted anything inside the image at one of the dropped paths
(`/app/scripts`, `/app/lib`, `/app/tsconfig.json`) for custom tooling,
that's the only meaningful breakage - those are build-time artefacts
and shouldn't be mounted in production, but the upgrade now enforces
it.

### Upgrading to 1.2.0 (from 1.1.x)

A **minor release** - no schema migration, no API changes, drop-in upgrade.
There is **one new env var with a behaviour-change default**, and a fix for
operators running standalone PowerDNS.

> **NOTE: This release introduces `PDNS_BACKGROUND_POLLING` which defaults to `false`.**
> If you currently rely on the SYNCED/DESYNCED chip, the dashboard
> "PowerDNS metrics" tab, the per-zone "Sync" or "Statistics" tabs, the
> servers-list Sync column, the zones-list mirror column, or drift-derived
> advisories in the bell, **you MUST NOW ENABLE** `PDNS_BACKGROUND_POLLING=true`
> in your environment and restart the app to keep those surfaces working.
> With the flag at its default (`false`), all of those features hide;
> the rest of AuthAdmin (zones, records, DNSSEC, TSIG, autoprimaries,
> audit, RBAC, OIDC, signup) is unchanged.

What also changes after the upgrade:

- **Standalone PDNS Auth instances (no `primary=yes` or `secondary=yes`
  in `pdns.conf`) become usable as zone-create targets.** Until 1.2.0,
  AuthAdmin was treating "no replication flag set" as "not writable" -
  hiding the backend from `/zones/new`'s picker even though **Test**
  went green. After upgrading those backends appear on the create-zone
  page automatically; nothing to reconfigure. (Closes #57.)
- **Capability badge `none` → `standalone`** for those backends. Same
  neutral tone, accurate label.
- If you applied the **`primary=yes` workaround** mentioned in #57 to
  unblock zone creation on a standalone, you can now revert it from
  `pdns.conf`. The override was operationally harmless either way - no
  slaves to NOTIFY - but the badge will read `standalone` correctly
  once it's gone.

#### Choosing your `PDNS_BACKGROUND_POLLING` value

| Deployment shape                                                          | Set `PDNS_BACKGROUND_POLLING` to     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Single PowerDNS server / standalone / homelab - no AXFR replication.      | `false` (the new default - leave it) |
| Multiple standalone PowerDNS instances, none acting as primary/secondary. | `false`                              |
| One primary with one or more secondaries replicating its zones via AXFR.  | `true` _(strongly recommended)_      |
| Two or more PowerDNS instances forming a multi-primary cluster.           | `true` _(strongly recommended)_      |

**With `PDNS_BACKGROUND_POLLING=false` (default):**

- AuthAdmin contacts PDNS only in direct response to operator actions:
  page renders, **Test**, **Refresh All**, zone create/edit/delete,
  DNSSEC/TSIG/autoprimaries actions. No background traffic.
- The supplementary "replication-awareness" surfaces are hidden - see
  the list under "MUST NOW ENABLE" above.
- The dashboard renders the Admin view only; a small `(i)` icon by the
  page heading explains how to enable polling.
- Operator clicks on a direct URL to a gated feature get a red error
  toast naming the env var.

**With `PDNS_BACKGROUND_POLLING=true`:**

- The unified background poller runs on its 30 s / 60 s / 5 min
  cadences against every configured backend.
- All replication-awareness features are visible and live:
  - SYNCED / DESYNCED chip in the top header (per-page where
    relevant; fleet-wide on most pages).
  - **Sync** + **Statistics** tabs on every zone-detail page.
  - **Sync** column on `/admin/servers`.
  - Mirror column on `/zones`.
  - **PowerDNS metrics** tab on the dashboard, including the live
    time-series charts (query rate, latency, cache hit, response
    composition by qtype/rcode/size).
  - Drift-derived advisories surfaced in the bell.
- A boot-time log line confirms the mode and (when off) whether the
  configured fleet looks like it would benefit from being on.

At the moment of the upgrade decision: most single-PowerDNS / small
deployments will get a quieter, friendlier experience by leaving the
flag at its default. Multi-replica and clustered operators will want
to set it `true` immediately and restart so AuthAdmin's full
operational surface is back.

### Upgrading to 1.1.5 (from 1.1.x)

A **security-hygiene patch.** No app-code changes; no schema, API, or
config changes. Pull-and-recreate.

Adds a defensive `package.json` `overrides` pin keeping `size-sensor` at
`1.0.3` (the last clean version) - closes the resolver attack window for
the **Mini Shai-Hulud** npm campaign that hijacked `size-sensor` `1.0.4`
/ `1.1.4` / `1.2.4` on 2026-05-19. **PowerDNS-AuthAdmin was never

### Upgrading to 1.1.4 (from 1.1.x)

A **major operator-UX release** - drop-in upgrade. **No schema migration, no API
changes, no config changes.** Pull-and-recreate the container and you're done.

What changes when operators sign in:

- **Mobile-first responsive shell.** Every page is usable on a phone now.
  Drawer-style navigation under `md`; full sidebar from `md+`.
- **Live status chip in the top bar** - connection state plus a fleet-wide
  sync verdict (`SYNCED` / `DESYNCED`) on every page, with the per-page
  override on zone-detail / zones-list / servers preserved.
- **New animated SyncIndicator** - concentric-ring glyph used everywhere a
  sync state is displayed. Honours `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Diff-before-apply on every record edit.** Save is now two clicks: an
  inline edit, then a **Review changes** modal with the BIND-style diff,
  then Save.
- **One-button theme toggle** cycles light → dark → system.
- **Every list is one DataTable.** Mobile reflows to labelled cards; the
  desktop chrome is uniform across audit / zones / users / roles / teams /
  PDNS requests / OIDC / TSIG / autoprimaries / zone templates.
- **CSS-only changes** - no client-side breaking changes; saved theme
  preferences, sessions, MFA enrolments, API tokens all carry over.

If you've embedded our screenshots in your own docs, note that several
filenames changed in this release - the canonical set is now
[`screenshots/README.md`](../screenshots/README.md).

### Upgrading to 1.1.3 (from 1.1.x)

A maintenance release - **no schema migration**, a plain pull-and-recreate, and
nothing operator-facing to change. It fixes per-zone grants on multi-primary
clusters (a grant on one peer now authorizes the zone on every peer), renames the
internal request middleware to the Next 16 `proxy` convention (transparent), and
re-pins the CI GitHub Actions to Node 24 (CI-only).

### Upgrading to 1.1.2 (from 1.1.x)

A security release - **no schema migration**, a plain pull-and-recreate. Two
behavioural changes that close enforcement gaps (they may surface as a new `403`
for accounts that were previously able to bypass a gate via the API):

- **Required-MFA and forced-password-change are now enforced on the API, not just
  in the browser.** If a user's role requires MFA, or the user is flagged "must
  change password", their session is now refused on write routes until they
  enroll TOTP / change their password (the enrollment, change-password, and
  logout endpoints stay reachable). This previously only redirected the browser,
  so a direct API caller could skip it. No action needed unless you rely on
  required-MFA accounts driving the API without having enrolled - have them
  enroll.
- **Privilege ceilings are enforced on more admin paths.** Creating a user with
  an initial role, resetting another user's password, and removing another user's
  MFA now refuse to act beyond the actor's own global permissions. Operators using
  only the built-in roles are unaffected.

### Upgrading to 1.1.1 (from 1.1.0)

A maintenance + security release - **no schema migration**, so it's a plain
pull-and-recreate. One behavioural change to be aware of:

- **OIDC `requireEmailVerified` now defaults to `true`** for newly-created
  DB-backed providers (account-takeover hardening). **Existing provider rows keep
  their stored value**, so nothing changes for them on upgrade - but if you have a
  provider with `requireEmailVerified` set to `false`, audit it: confirm the IdP
  genuinely never emits the `email_verified` claim before keeping it off. See
  [OIDC](./05-OIDC.md).

Everything else in this release (the security batch, the CSP and supply-chain
hardening, and the opt-in additions like self-service signup) is transparent on
upgrade - signup stays off unless you set `SIGNUP_ENABLED=true`.

### Upgrading to 1.1.0 (from 1.0.x)

One schema migration applies on first boot (`0003_backend_caps_advisories_squash`).
It is **data-preserving** - verified end-to-end against a real 1.0.x SQLite
deployment (servers, users, roles, audit history all retained).

Two behavioural points specific to this release (ADR-0014 / ADR-0017):

- **Per-server `role` and `primary_id` are retired.** The migration drops those
  columns; a backend's primary/secondary nature is now **observed** from its
  `/config` and its primary↔secondary links **derived** from each zone's
  `masters[]`. On the first boot after upgrade, every backend's `capabilities`
  start empty and are re-populated by the first poll (seconds), so backends may
  briefly show as "unknown" until that completes. A primary + secondaries that
  was wired only by the old `primary_id` pin re-derives automatically when the
  secondary's zones list the primary's advertised address - otherwise group them
  under **Admin → Clusters** (or set the primary's advertised addresses).
- **Keep your `APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.** Stored PDNS API keys and OIDC client
  secrets are decrypted with it; an upgrade that loses the key can't decrypt them
  (you'd see `Unsupported state or unable to authenticate data` in the logs).
  This isn't new in 1.1.0, but the backup step above is the reminder.

If you run **SQLite**, this release also requires no manual steps - the squashed
migration handles the column add/drop in one table rebuild (see
[ADR-0017](./adr/0017-migration-squash-1.1.0.md) for the SQLite-specific detail).

## Rollback

Migrations are **forward-only** - there are no automated down-migrations. To roll
back the application image you must also restore the database to its
pre-upgrade backup, because a newer migration may have changed the schema in ways
the older image doesn't understand.

```sh
# 1. stop the app   2. restore the DB backup   3. pin the previous image tag
docker compose down
# …restore Postgres dump / SQLite file…
docker compose up -d
```

This is why **the pre-upgrade backup is non-negotiable**: it's your only rollback
path.

## Multi-replica notes (Postgres)

Several replicas can boot at once - the migration step takes a `pg_advisory_lock`
so exactly one applies migrations while the others wait. Combined with `/readyz`
gating, a rolling deploy won't send traffic to a replica until its schema is
current. To run migrations as a separate pipeline step instead, set
`MIGRATE_ON_BOOT=false` and run `npm run db:migrate` before rolling the app.

For replicas > 1 you also need `REDIS_URL` set so auth rate limiting, reveal-once
tokens, and the realtime event-bus coordinate across replicas (sessions already do

- they're in Postgres). See [ADR-0016](./adr/0016-redis-horizontal-scale.md) and the
  [High availability](../README.md#high-availability-replicas--1) compose example.
